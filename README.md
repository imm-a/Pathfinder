<b>Welcome to my Pathfinder.</b>

It consists of two start and end nodes and allows you to move them around and create obstacles. It then finds the best/ least cost combination of nodes and displays the path.
It uses the A-star algorithm to find the shortest path.
It is made from a flask REST API backend and a React frontend.

To start, clone the repository.

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Navigate to pathfinder-api, which contains the backend.

Use <i>python app.py</i> to run flask server.

Navigate to pathfront, which contains the frontend.

Use <i>npm start</i> to start the react server. This will automatically open up the frontend in your browser.

Happy Pathfinding!
